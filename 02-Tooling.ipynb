Not only do I spend hours completing assignments to the best of my ability, but I make sure to test out EACH AND EVERY PIECE of code I wrote in these assignments to make sure my code is “spitting out” what I am expecting, and to show you and the TAs what I was trying to do just in case I get something wrong (because showing work for some points is better than showing no work for 0 points, you know?)*\n",
